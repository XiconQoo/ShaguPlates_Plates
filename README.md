# ShaguPlates + Plates merge TBC
# CAUTION : THIS MOD MIGHT GET YOU BANNED ON SOME SERVERS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

### This is a merge of Plates by Siggestardust and ShaguPlates by Shagu. It provides less clutter of nameplates.
## [v1.0-Release Download Here](https://github.com/XiconQoo/ShaguPlates_Plates/releases/download/v1.0-Release/ShaguPlates_Plates-v1.0-Release.zip)

## HOW TO

1) Extract this into your World of Warcraftr folder. Make sure to delete ShaguPlates-tbc before doing so.
2) Also there is a WTF with my ShaguPlates configuration. It is not needed. Put it in the respective folders (ACCOUNTNAME, REALMNAME, CHARNAME)
3) Included is a ``WoW_ext_nameplates.exe`` which is needed to start WoW with for this edit to work. It also increases the nameplate range.

## Recommended addons to use with these nameplates:

### [XiconPlateBuffs](https://github.com/XiconQoo/XiconPlateBuffs)
### [Icicle](https://github.com/XiconQoo/Icicle)

##### You can edit Plates.lua line 14-15 width/heigth to achieve even less clutter. Personally I don't like overlapping nameplates.
```
local width = 85
local height = 20
```

##### Join the [TBC addons 2.4.3 Discord](https://discord.gg/5qVu56M) by Macumba if you have any questions.
